# Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems and Applications: A Survey

This repository is associated with the paper 
- Ferdinando Fioretto, Enrico Pontelli, William Yeoh. "_Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems and Applications: A Survey_" J. Artif. Intell. Res. 61: 623-698 (2018) 

The above surveys the state-of-the-art on Distributed Multiagent optimization. 

The authors will release regular updates of paper on the associated [ArXiv release](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06347) 
to include new distributed algorithms, model, and applications proposed by researchers in the community. 

The changes will be logged and can be seen [here](#log).

## Submit your work

A list of algorithms currently described in the survey available [here](#algorighms). 

If your work is not currently covered and you would like the authors to include it 
in the survey, you can send a request: 

[Submit your request](https://forms.gle/neSjptZocJT3VVzf9)

Therein, please report:
- Why is the algorithm/model relevant to the survey.
- A summary of the algorithm, model, or application (no more than 2000 characters).
- For algorithmic work: 
  + Where does the new algorithm fall in the algorithm taxonomy described in Figure 5 of the survey paper
  + A summary of the results obtained by the new algorithm (on which benchmarks was it evaluated, 
  which algorithms have been compared, what are the results?)
- For new applications: 
  + In which category does the new application falls with respect to the categorization 
  reported in Table 5 of the survey paper.

Failure to provide the required information may result in rejecting the proposal.
